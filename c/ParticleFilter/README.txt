PARTICLE FILTER
For running on a host machine (tested on ubuntu and macOS)

THIS IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, has lots of hard coded values, but should run fine. 
Originally relied on GSL and SMCTC libraries, but those files are severely pared down and included
as source here. Most unused options from those libraries are ommitted. 

Requires data80.csv in the same folder.

sirTest.cpp is the top level cpp file
